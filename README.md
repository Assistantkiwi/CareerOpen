# CareerOpen
A job search platform.
This project was done by Group 7 SCAxFedEx final project.

Figma Design : "https://www.figma.com/design/MzgV9haqlzs0tknGSu4Dhx/CareerOpen"

My design process.
## Project Name: Frontend Development with React and Tailwind CSS

* Project Setup:
    * Created a GitHub repository and cloned it to VSCode.
* Design Implementation:
    * Integrated React and Tailwind CSS for frontend design.
* User Interface Development:
    * Constructed desktop navigation bar and form components.
* Framework Integration:
    * Addressed framework compatibility issues encountered during form development.
* Deployment:
    * Established live link on Vercel for project deployment.
* Backend Collaboration:
    * Collaborated with backend team to integrate endpoint APIs for sign-up and sign-in forms.
* API Testing:
    * Tested APIs using Postman before integration.
* Integration and Finalization:
    * Integrated APIs after necessary corrections and completed form development.
* Finishing Touches and Deployment:
    * Applied all finishing touches, pushed changes, and deployed the project.

Errors 
* The sign up component page does not render on another page but on the homepage (this is a work in process).
* The button on the sign up page is smaller and when fixed it affects the main page (this is also a work in progress).
* The job application filter is unresponsive.
* The form does not store the user information on the backend (this is a very big hiccup).
* The pop up box for the job seekers / employers stated in the figma design has not been worked on yet.
